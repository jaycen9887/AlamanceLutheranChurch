                                      WELCOME to Alamance Lutheran Church -  A church where we seek to nurture our members so that they can become instruments of God's love in our church, our community and around the world.
                                  </p>
                                  
                                  <p>
                                    We invite you to join us at one of our worship opportunities as we hear and share the love and grace of our savior, Jesus Christ. We hold worship in an informal, contemporary style at 8:30 AM and in a traditional Lutheran liturgy at 11:00 AM each Sunday.
                                  </p>
                                
                                  <p>
                                    Alamance Lutheran is an active church in the Burlington area with many ministry opportunities for our members to participate in both during and outside of the church service.  We are a parish of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the North Carolina Synod.
                                  </p>

                                    We are glad you found us and hope this website gives you a glimpse into whom and why we are. Directions to our church and information about parking and entering our church building can be found here.

                                                    The ELCA confesses the Triune God — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. In our preaching and teaching the ELCA trusts the Gospel as the power of God for the salvation of all who believe. 
                                                </p>

                                                    ELCA teaching or theology serves the proclamation and ministry of this faith. It does not have an answer for all questions, not even all religious questions. Teaching or theology prepares members to be witnesses in speech and in action of God’s rich mercy in Jesus Christ.

                                                      The ELCA’s official Confession of Faith identifies the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments (commonly called the Bible); the Apostles’, Nicene and Athanasian Creeds; and the Lutheran confessional writings in the Book of Concord as the basis for our teaching. ELCA congregations make the same affirmation in their governing documents, and ELCA pastors promise to preach and teach in accordance with these teaching sources. This Confession of Faith is more than just words in an official document. Every Sunday in worship ELCA congregations hear God’s word from the Scriptures, pray as Jesus taught and come to the Lord’s Table expecting to receive the mercies that the Triune God promises. Throughout the week ELCA members continue to live by faith, serving others freely and generously in all that they do because they trust God’s promise in the Gospel. In small groups and at sick beds, in private devotions and in daily work, this faith saturates all of life.

The Holy Spirit uses these witnesses to create, strengthen and sustain faith in Jesus Christ and the life we have in him. That life-giving work continues every day, as Martin Luther explained in the Small Catechism: the Holy Spirit “calls, gathers, enlightens and sanctifies the whole Christian church on earth and preserves it in union with Jesus Christ in the one true faith.”

                                               The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) is one of the largest Christian denominations in the United States, with about 4 million members in nearly 10,000 congregations across the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We are the church that shares a living, daring confidence in God’s grace. For us, as the ELCA, this faith comes through the good news of Jesus Christ and gives us the freedom and the courage to wonder, discover and boldly participate in what God is up to in the world. We are a church that is always being made new, and at the same time, is deeply rooted in Scripture, Lutheran theology and Lutheran confessions. We are also rooted in the vibrant, diverse communities and rich histories of our congregations. It’s through these roots that the Holy Spirit guides and nourishes us so that we can be a church that is both resilient and always new. We welcome you to join this community of faith — the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America — regardless of your age, race, gender, life experience, complexities and questions. You have a unique story that can only add to the richness of the larger story that makes up the ELCA. There is a place for you here!

The 2011 Churchwide Assembly endorsed the work of the task force and supported its future work in collaboration with other church bodies and committees.

                                                A merger of three Lutheran churches formed the ELCA in 1988. They were The American Lutheran Church, the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches and the Lutheran Church in America. Now 25 years later, the ELCA is a church that shares a living, daring confidence in God’s grace. As members of the ELCA, we believe that we are freed in Christ to serve and love our neighbor. With our hands, we do God’s work of restoring and reconciling communities in Jesus Christ’s name throughout the world. We trace our roots back through the mid-17th century, when early Lutherans came to America from Europe, settling in the Virgin Islands and the area that is now known as New York. Even before that, Martin Luther sought reform for the church in the 16th century, laying the framework for our beliefs. - See more at: <a href="http://www.elca.org/About/History#sthash.JIktRdMx.dpuf" target="_blank">www.elca.org</a>

                    <p>
                        As Christians, weekly worship is very important to us and is an integral part of our church and our lives. At ALC, worship is offered in two formats each Sunday morning. At 8:30am, we gather for a less formal worship service accompanied by piano and guitar. At 11:00am, we gather for a service steeped in the Lutheran tradition but geared toward modern times. Holy Communion is celebrated at both services each Sunday and Sunday School is held in between services at 10:00am. Please join us at one (or both) of these great services to sing God's praises!
